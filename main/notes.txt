Neural network activation:
    1. Start node outputs signal based on player input
    2. Edge is triggered when node output reaches edge threshold
    3. Edge transfers signal to next node
    4. Receiving node directly outputs signal with weight based on strength of inputs

Snake has small area of vision out from head
If apple in area of vision send signal to network

Input nodes:
    One node for each square in the field of view of the snake

Output nodes:
    Left
    Right
    Up
    Down
