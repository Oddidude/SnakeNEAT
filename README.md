# SnakeNEAT

This is my attempt at implementing the NEAT machine learning algorithm for the game Snake.
It's fairly unpolished but the game and algorithm work properly.

## Running the program

Use the included .jar file to run the app or open index.html in your favourite browser.

Alternatively you can use the below link to take you to the Github Pages hosted version.

## Controls

Controls are fairly basic:

- F - Print the neural network structure of the current fittest snake to console
- J - Toggle between viewing the snakes and stats or only stats
- H - Only draw the fittest snake currently alive
- P - Toggle pause game
- Q - Stop the program running

Enjoy my project!
