# SnakeNEAT

This is my attempt at implementing the NEAT machine learning algorithm into the game Snake.
It's fairly unpolished but the game and algorithm work properly, despite how messy most of the code is.

## Running the program

Simply open the _index.html_ file in your favourite browser and watch it go

## Controls

Controls are fairly basic:

- F - Print the neural network structure of the current fittest snake to console
- J - Toggle between viewing the snakes and stats or only stats
- H - Only draw the fittest snake currently alive
- P - Toggle pause game
- Q - Stop the program running

Enjoy my project!
